In this section, we briefly describe the structure of the three data sources.% before summarizing the steps taken to harmonize the sources and discussing the limitations in the current application.

\subsection{United States: \acf{LBD}}

\input{data-us.tex}

\subsection{Canada: \acf{LEAP}}

\input{data-canada.tex}

\subsection{Germany: \acf{BHP}}

\input{data-germany.tex}

\subsection{Comparability and Pre-processing}

\subsection{Harmonizing and Preprocessing}

In all countries, the underlying data provides annual measures. However, \SynLBD{} assumes a longitudinal (wide) structure of the dataset, with invariant industry (and location). In all cases, the modal industry is chosen to represent the entity's industrial activity.

Further adjustments made to the \ac{BHP} for this project include estimating full-year payroll, creating time-consistent geographic information, and applying employment flow methods \citep{RePEc:iab:iabfme:201006_en} to adjust for spurious births and deaths in establishment identifiers. \citet{SJIAOS-2014b} provide a detailed description of the steps taken to harmonize the input data. 


In both Canada and Germany, we encountered various technical and data-driven limitations. In all countries, data in the first year and last year are occasionally problematic, and such data  were dropped. 
%
Both the German and the Canadian data experience some level of industry coding change, which may affect the classification of some entities. Furthermore, due to the nature of the underlying data, entities are establishments in Germany and the US, but employers in Canada. 

After the various standardizations and choices made above, the data structure is intended to be comparable, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:common_Variable}. The column "Nature" identifies the treatment of the variable in the synthesis process \SynLBD.
