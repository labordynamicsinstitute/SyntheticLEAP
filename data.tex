In this section, we briefly describe the structure of the original US dataset, then the specific Canadian and Germany databases, that served as inputs for the algorithm.

\subsection{United States: \acf{LBD}}

\input{data-us.tex}

\subsection{Canada: \acf{LEAP}}

\input{data-canada.tex}

\subsection{Germany: \acf{BHP}}

\input{data-germany.tex}

\subsection{Overview}

After the various standardizations and choices made above, the data structure is intended to be comparable, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:common_Variable}.
