%The US SynLBD was released in 2010 to the Cornell SDS. The Census Bureauâ€™s Disclosure Review Board (DRB), as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), classified SynLBD as public-use, but access is controlled due to concerns about the quality of the data. There are no disclosure concerns but researchers are cautioned not to trust results as if they were created by a traditional public-use file without going through the validation process. For similar reasons, the preparation of tabular data based on the synthetic data is strongly discouraged, and are not validated. Nevertheless, the synthetic data are of much easier access than the confidential data.


The Synthetic LBD is derived from the LBD as a partially synthetic database with analytic validity, by synthesizing the life-span of establishments, as well as the evolution of their employment, conditional on industry. Geography is not synthesized, but is suppressed from the released file. The current version 2.0 is based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and extends through 2000. Work currently underway using the existing methodology will extend the data through 2010, using NAICS, and newer imputation methodology (Version 3) is under development (see paper by Kinney and Reiter in this issue) to improve the analytic validity and extend the imputation to additional variables. In this paper, when we refer to the "SynLBD algorithms", we refer to Version 2. \\

\subsection{Overview}

There is growing demand for firm-level data allowing detailed studies of firm dynamics. Recent examples include \textcite{NBERc0480} who use cross-country firm-level data to study average post-entry behavior of young firms. \textcite{10.1257/aer.20141280} use the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) to show the role of firm size in firm dynamics. However, such studies are made difficult due to the limited or restricted access to firm-level data. To provide better access to establishment data in the United States, \textcite{KinneyEtAl2011} describe an approach to create and release synthetic data for Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), which was created in the early 2000s (see \textcite{RePEc:cen:wpaper:02-17} for details). The variables currently available in the LBD are industry, annual payroll, employment, geography (county), birth year, death year, year, and firm structure (multiunit status).    

We can currently distinguish between two methods to create synthetic data. The general approach to data synthesis is to generate a joint posterior predictive distribution of $Y|X$ where $Y$ are variables to be synthesized and $X$ are unsynthesized variables. In the Phase 1 version of the method, variables are synthesized in a sequential fashion, with categorical variables being generally processed first using a variant of Dirichlet-Multinomial. Continuous variables are then synthesized using a normal linear regression model with kennel density-based transformation (\textcite{WOODCOCK20094228}). 

The Phase 2 version of the method has shifted to a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model with Bayesian bootstrap. For the United States, the phase 2 version  is currently in its final stages of implementation (\textcite{RePEc:cen:wpaper:14-12}). 

To evaluate whether synthetic data algorithms developed in the U.S. can be adapted to generate similar synthetic data for other countries, \textcite{RePEc:cen:wpaper:14-13} implement the Phase 1 version of the method to the German Longitudinal Business Database (GLBD). 

\subsection{Implementation in the Canadian context}

To create a Canadian synthetic database, we use the 2015 LEAP vintage. As for the U.S. synthetic database for LBD,\todo{BD: Is the name SynLBD official, and should we use it?} \todo{JA: I think we could use it. However, I did use a few times.} we synthesize categorical variables first, followed by continuous variables, controlling for the firm ID and industry classification at 4-digit NAICS (see Table~\ref{tab:LEAP_Variable}.)

After implementing the U.S. synthetic LBD code, we follow four steps to create a Canadian synthetic database. \begin{enumerate}
    \item We exclude the public sector (NAICS 61, 62, and 91) because Statistics Canada does not produce any statistics for those sectors.
    \item We exclude industries for which the algorithm is not converging. These industries are NAICS 4481,    4482,     4483,     4511,     4513,     4841,     4842,     5241, and 5242. These industries represent approximately 7 percent of the total number of observations and are labeled as ``not synthesized'' in Table \ref{Synthesized_observations}.
    \item We drop some industries, from the synthesized industries, which have less than ten observations in a given year.
    \item We drop observation for the last year each firm was observed since the SynLBD code does not properly approximate the last year of the data.
\end{enumerate}. 
After the implementation of these steps, we have around 22 million observations in the CanSynLBD database during the period of 1991 - 2014.
