## Source data
All source data is confidential, available on restricted-access servers:
 - Confidential LEAP: Access can be requested at Statistics Canada/ CDER (URL), access will occur either via access through the use of the Synthetic LEAP, or in person at Statistics Canada facilities in Ottawa, ON, Canada. Access modalities are outlined at (URL). Do we have a FILEID or something?
 - Synthetic LEAP: Access can be requested through the Canadian Research Data Center Network (URL). Do we have a FILEID or something?

 ## Derivative data
 This directory contains derivative data only, parameter estimates stemming from computations on the confidential and synthetic data above. All graphs are produced based on these data.

 As of this writing (2018-02-16), the graphs were created in the confidential area of CDER, reviewed by Statistics Canada for disclosure issues, and released to one of the authors, in Stata GPH format (see directory "stata-graphs"). The data were then extracted from the GPH using programs in the "programs" directory.
