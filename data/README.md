# Data directory

## Source data
All source data is confidential, available on restricted-access servers:
 - Confidential LEAP: Access to the [LEAP](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/cder/data#a6) can be requested at Statistics Canada/ CDER ([https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/cder/index](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/cder/index)), access will occur either via access through the use of the Synthetic LEAP, or in person at Statistics Canada facilities in Ottawa, ON, Canada. 
 - Synthetic LEAP: Release of the data was not requested; data are thus still considered to be confidential. The data were generated on internal servers, and accessed by one of the authors during his stay at Statistics Canada. None of the authors currently have access to the data. Data may be accessible through the CDER access process outlined above. 
 - Access to the BHP (in English: Establishment History Panel) is possible through the Research Data Center of the IAB ([https://fdz.iab.de/en.aspx](https://fdz.iab.de/en.aspx)). One of the authors, as an IAB employee, had access to the internal version of the data not available to researchers. Release of the data was not requested; data are thus still considered to be confidential.

 ## Derivative data

 This directory contains derivative data only, parameter estimates stemming from computations on the confidential and synthetic data above. All graphs are produced based on these data.

 As of this writing (2018-02-16), the graphs were created in the confidential area of CDER, reviewed by Statistics Canada for disclosure issues, and released to one of the authors, in Stata GPH format (see directory "stata-graphs"). The data were then extracted from the GPH using programs in the "programs" directory. Other data were parsed from log files, and re-saved as CSV files.
