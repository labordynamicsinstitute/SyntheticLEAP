\subsection{Confidence interval for gross employment and other measures}
We compute the standard error for gross employment as follows. We consider gross employment $E$ to be the sum of firm employments $E_j$:

\begin{equation}
E = \sum_j E_j
\end{equation}

Average firm employment $\bar{E} = \frac{E}{N_j}$ is assumed to be normally distributed, with standard deviation $\sigma_{\bar{E}}$. We compare the synthetic and the confidential data for gross employment, including error bands.

%\begin{itemize}
%%\item %\textcite{10.1257/aer.20141280} use the BDS to show the role of firm size in firm dynamics, but also had access to the Synthetic LBD.
%\item \textcite{NBERc0480} use a cross-country dataset to study average post-entry behavior of young firms.
