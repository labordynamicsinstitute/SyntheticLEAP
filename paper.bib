Combining comprehensive business registries and predictive analytics, we present estimates of entrepreneurial quantity and quality from 1988-2014. Rather than a secular pattern of declining business dynamism, our quality-adjusted measures follow a cyclical pattern sensitive to economic and capital market conditions. Consistent with the role of investment cycles as a driver of high-growth entrepreneurship, our results highlight the role of economic and institutional conditions as a driver of both initial entrepreneurial quality and the scaling of new ventures over time.},

abstract = {Summary Data holders can produce synthetic versions of data sets when concerns about potential disclosure restrict the availability of the original records. The paper is concerned with methods to judge whether such synthetic data have a distribution that is comparable with that of the original data: what we term general utility. We consider how general utility compares with specific utility: the similarity of results of analyses from the synthetic data and the original data. We adapt a previous general measure of data utility, the propensity score mean-squared error pMSE, to the specific case of synthetic data and derive its distribution for the case when the correct synthesis model is used to create the synthetic data. Our asymptotic results are confirmed by a simulation study. We also consider two specific utility measures, confidence interval overlap and standardized difference in summary statistics, which we compare with the general utility results. We present two contrasting examples of data syntheses: one illustrating synthetic data that is evaluated as being useful by both general and specific measures and the second where neither is the case. For the second case we show how the general utility measures can identify the deficiencies of the synthetic data and suggest how this can inform possible improvements to the synthesis method.},

With globalization markets have also become more interconnected. Measuring business activity in this rapidly evolving environment increasingly requires tracking complex interactions among firms, establishments, employers, and employees. Understanding Business Dynamics presents strategies for improving the accuracy, timeliness, coverage, and integration of data that are used in constructing aggregate economic statistics, as well as in microlevel analyses of topics ranging from job creation and destruction and firm entry and exit to innovation and productivity. This book offers recommendations that could be enacted by federal statistical agencies to modernize the measurement of business dynamics, particularly the production of information on small and young firms that can have a disproportionately large impact in rapidly expanding economic sectors. It also outlines the need for effective coordination of existing survey and administrative data sources, which is essential to improving the depth and coverage of business data.",

The U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Internal Revenue Service recently approved the release of these synthetic microdata for public use, making the synthetic Longitudinal Business Database the first-ever business microdata set publicly released in the United States.

The final goal of the project described in this paper will be to evaluate whether synthetic data algorithms developed in the U.S. to generate a synthetic version of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) can easily be transferred to generate a similar data product for other countries. We construct a German data product with infor- mation comparable to the LBD - the German Longitudinal Business Database (GLBD) - that is generated from different administrative sources at the Institute for Employment Research, Germany. In a fu- ture step, the algorithms developed for the synthesis of the LBD will be applied to the GLBD. Extensive evaluations will illustrate whether the algorithms provide useful synthetic data without further adjustment. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide access to multiple synthetic datasets similar to the SynLBD at Cornell to enable comparative studies between countries. The Synthetic GLBD is a first step towards that goal.},

When the autoregressive parameter is moderately large and the number of time series observations is moderately small, the usual Generalised Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator obtained after first differencing has been found to be poorly behaved. Here we consider alternative linear estimators that are designed to improve the properties of the standard first-differenced GMM estimator. We consider two approaches to estimation. The first approach extends the model by adding the observed initial values as an extra regressor. This allows consistent estimates to be obtained by error-components GLS. This estimator is shown to be equivalent to the optimal GMM estimator for the normal homoskedastic error components model. The second approach considers a mild restriction on the initial condition process under which lagged differences in the dependent variable can be used to construct linear moment conditions in the levels equations. The complete set of moment conditions can then be exploited by a linear GMM estimator in a system of first-differenced and levels equations, rendering the non-linear moment conditions redundant for estimation. This estimator is strictly more efficient than non-linear GMM when the additional restriction is valid. Monte Carlo simulations are reported which demonstrate the dramatic improvement in performance of the proposed estimators compared to the usual first-differenced GMM estimator, especially for high values of the autoregressive parameter.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small><br><small>(This abst},

	abstract= {The Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) is a research dataset constructed at the Center for Economic Studies (CES).  Currently the LBD contains the universe of all U.S. business establishments with paid employees from 1976 to 1999.  The LBD is updated annually - the next update scheduled for late 2006 will add data through 2004 .
	
	The LBD offers researchers at CES and its affiliated Research Data Centers (RDCs)  a number of features not available in other longitudinal datasets.  These include:
	
	Long Time Series  - The LBD contains complete establishment histories from 1975 to 2005.  Precise birth and death year information are available for most establishments.
	
	Industrial Scope - The LBD contains all employer establishments that are in scope for the Economic Census (i.e. all manufacturing mining construction retail wholesale service TCU and FIRE establishments) as well as a large number of public administration and other out of scope entities.
	
	Improved Longitudinal linkages - In contructing the LBD great care was taken to provide researchers with the most complete and accurate set of longitudinal establishment linkages possible.  This substantially reduces the number spurious establishment births and deaths observed in the data.  In addition the LBD provides researchers with detailed flags that describe for each establishment the nature of the linkages over each year an establishment is observed in the data.
	
	Basic establishment demographic data - The LBD contains basic information on establishment size industry location and ownership that permit researchers to analyze establishment demographics.
	
	Linkages to other micro data - The research capabilities of the LBD can be greatly and easily enhanced by linking it to other establishment and firm information contained in Economic Census and survey files available at CES and the RDCs.
	
	More detailed information about the LBD is available in Jarmin and Miranda (CES-WP-2002-17).

We argue many lessons in this evolving field have been learned in the early years of synthetic data generation, and can be used in the development of new synthetic data products, considerably reducing the required in- vestments. The final goal of the project described in this paper will be to evaluate whether synthetic data algorithms developed in the U.S. to generate a synthetic version of the Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) can easily be transferred to generate a similar data product for other countries. We construct a German data product with infor- mation comparable to the LBD - the German Longitudinal Business Database (GLBD) - that is generated from different administrative sources at the Institute for Employment Research, Germany. In a fu- ture step, the algorithms developed for the synthesis of the LBD will be applied to the GLBD. Extensive evaluations will illustrate whether the algorithms provide useful synthetic data without further adjustment. The ultimate goal of the project is to provide access to multiple synthetic datasets similar to the SynLBD at Cornell to enable comparative studies between countries. The Synthetic GLBD is a first step towards that goal.},

The raw source data is usually considered to be confidential. In the case of the U.S. Census Bureau, confidentiality of survey and administrative records microdata is mandated by statute, and this mandate to protect confidentiality is often at odds with the needs of users to extract as much information from the data as possible. Traditional disclosure protection techniques result in official data products that do not fully utilize the information content of the underlying microdata. Typically, these products take the form of simple aggregate tabulations. In a few cases anonymized public- use micro samples are made available, but these face a growing risk of re-identification by the increasing amounts of information about individuals and firms available in the public domain. One approach for overcoming these risks is to release products based on synthetic data where values are simulated from statistical models designed to mimic the (joint) distributions of the underlying microdata. We discuss re- cent Census Bureau work to develop and deploy such products. We discuss the benefits and challenges involved with extending the scope of synthetic data products in official statistics.},

We first review the concepts of statistical disclosure limitation for an audience of economists who may be unfamiliar with these methods. Our main objective is to shed light on the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for empirical economic research. In general, the standard approach of ignoring statistical disclosure limitation leads to incorrect inference. We formalize statistical disclosure methods in a model of the data publication process. In the model, the statistical agency collects data from a population, but published a version of the data that have been intentionally distorted. The model allows us to characterize what it means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable, and to characterize what happens when it is not. We then consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for regression analysis, instrumental variable analysis, and regression discontinuity design. Because statistical agencies do not always report the methods they use to protect confidentiality, we use our model to characterize settings in which statistical disclosure limitation methods are discoverable; that is, they can be learned from the released data. We conclude with advice for researchers, journal editors, and statistical agencies.},

	abstract = {\&quot;Economists have long been interested in the determinants and
	components of job creation and destruction. In many countries administrative
	datasets provide an excellent source for detailed analysis on a fine
	and disaggregate level. However, administrative datasets are not
	without problems: restructuring and relabeling of firms is often
	poorly measured and can potentially create large biases. We provide
	evidence of the extent of this bias and provide a new solution to
	deal with it using the German Establishment History Panel (BHP).
	While previous research has relied on the first and last appearance
	of the establishment identifier (EID) to identify openings and closings,
	we improve on this approach using a new dataset containing all worker
	flows between establishments in Germany. This allows us to credibly
	identify establishment births and deaths from 1975 to 2004. We show
	that the misclassification bias of using only the EID is very severe:
	Only about 35 to 40 percent of new and disappearing EIDs with more
	than 3 employees correspond unambiguously to real establishment entries
	and exits. Among larger establishments misclassification is even
	more common. We show that many new establishment IDs appear to be
	'Spin-Offs' and these have become increasingly more common over time.
	We then demonstrate that using only EID entries and exits may dramatically
	overstate, by as much as 100 percent, the role of establishment turnover
	for job creation and destruction. Furthermore correcting job creation
	and destruction measures for spurious EID entries and exits reduces
	these measures and aligns them closer with the business cycle.\&quot;

	abstract={The Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) Program at the U.S. Census Bureau, with the support of several national research agencies, maintains a set of infrastructure files using administrative data provided by state agencies, enhanced with information from other administrative data sources, demographic and economic (business) surveys and censuses. The LEHD Infrastructure Files provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of workers, employers, and their interaction in the U.S. economy. This document describes the structure and content of the 2014 Snapshot of the LEHD Infrastructure files as they are made available in the Census Bureau’s secure and restricted-access Research Data Center network. The document attempts to provide a comprehensive description of all researcher-accessible files, of their creation, and of any modifications made to the files to facilitate researcher access.},
