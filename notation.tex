$\beta_x$ are parameters (0,1,2,3 in pMSE)
$\lambda_t$ is a time (year) effect
Subscript $e$ is for entity
Subscript $i$ is for industry
$\alpha_x$ is for entity effects, and should thus have $e$ as subscript
Industry effects should use (new) $\gamma$ with subscript $i$
$\epsilon$ is used for generic first-level error
Variables are $Emp$ = employment, $Pay$ for payroll, $Age$ for entity age.
